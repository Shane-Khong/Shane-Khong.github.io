    <div class="about">
       <p class="about-me">Just a student studying Commerce/Law that enjoys learning new things 
       <br><br>At the moment I'm learning how to develop my own webpage</p>
    </div>

      <div class = "hobby"><h2>Saying Fit</h2></div>
        <p class="staying-fit">Gym: The one hobby that's stayed with me over the years. I love it because it's the most efficient form of exercise. <br><br> Indoor Soccer: It's the team sport I've been searching for. I'm terrible at it at the moment, but slowly wearing in the futsal shoes and I hope to become a good player in a league!</p>
        <!--MAKE <p> A DROP DOWN MENU-->
      <div class = "hobby"><h2>Investing</h2></div>
        <p class="investing">After learning Taxation law at university, I created a monthly budget to determine how much I would put away based on my graduate salary. It did not look good. I read Robert Kiyosaki's book Rich Dad Poor Dad and I am confident it has changed my outlook on life. The biggest thing it taught me was that a salary is not enough and never will be. I need to find another income stream, preferrably passive income.</p>
      <div class = "hobby"><h2>Learning Code</h2></div>
        <p class="learning-code">I've missed the boat on the property market. So what now? I reckon I have two options: (1) the stock market and (2) the internet. As the market is currently WAY overpriced, I've decided to wait until the crash (and save money). <br><br> In the meantime, I've taken coding classes! so far I've learned the basics of HTML and CSS which I'm using to create this website! I am also currently learning JavaScript with plans on learning Python. This is actually really fun because you get to solve problems whilst creating your own stuff!</p>
        <div class = "hobby"><h2>Learning Chinese</h2></div>
        <p class="learning-chinese">FINALLY I've found something to motivate me to learn. DuoLingo finally put in a Chinese Course. Time to get better acquainted with the language of my ancestors!</p>
