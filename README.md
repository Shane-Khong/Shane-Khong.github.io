Hi, I am learning how to code and use github. This repo shows my journey of what I learned. To add context to what I learn I'll be filling it with my hobbies or things which interest me at the moment!

So far I've learned html and CSS through CodeAcademy

I am also planning on learning:
  JavaScript
  Python

I plan on revising my knowledge through using these sources:
  FreeCodeCamp
  edX
  YouTube (of course!)
